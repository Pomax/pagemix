# v1.2.0

- Added style capturing, so that during save/publish all current stylesheet information
  is written to a <style> element, and <link rel="stylesheet"> are removed. This keeps
  pages looking pretty rather than super weird when the servers that host the external
  stylesheets refuse to send them over due to CORS restrictions.

# v1.1.0

- Added a "parent" button to select the currently loaded element's parent tree instead
- Added a "help" menu
- Added a modal system so that publishing doesn't bombard you with a series
  of confirm() and prompt() dialogs.

# v1.0.1

- Removed the document listening for the 'x' key, because it kept triggering
  the extension even when you were just typing a comment somewhere. Not super nice =)

# v1.0

- Initial release
